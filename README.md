# Neotectonics-and-Tectonic-Geomorphology---GEO.MD2.2UB





Open the ***neotek_script.mlx*** by double-clicking it or executing the coomand -> ***open neotek_script.mlx*** in the Command Window in Matlab.

From now on we will work in this script, perform all the topographic analyses and produce figures. The figures will output inline below the command.


Good Luck ;)
